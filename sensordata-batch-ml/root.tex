\section{Reference implementation}

This architecture was used in a connected fitness application. The application processes inputs from one or more sensors (smartwatch, HR sensor, smart clothes) to track fitness regimes and to deliver targeted health and fitness advice to the users. 

The application on the user's smartphone connects data from the available sensors, combines it with a statistical model of the user's behaviour, and---where available---fine-grained location services. These three inputs allow the application to make the first distinction: exercise vs. no-exercise. From the user's perspective, the system is an automated fitness trainer; from a data scientist's perspective, the biometric data the system collects allows for detailed analysis of exercises, exercise regimes, impact of exercise on the users' well-being, automated physiotherapy, and many other applications.

\subsection{Main components}

The sensors shown here as consumer-grade wearables perform only the basic hardware interaction: there is no pre-processing of the recorded data. The system accepts accelerometer, gyroscope, heart rate and---where available---data from strain gauges in smart clothes. The mobile application performs the real-time processing of the inputs, displays the next exercise the user should perform (allowing the user to change the suggestion by simply walking to a station for a different exercise, or by beginning a different exercise). The mobile application also prompts the user to confirm correct labels for the recorded data. \emph{This is the key component in the entire system: the frictionless user experience gives the system very accurate labels on very clean data}.

The mobile submits the entire session data (the sensor data, matching labels and latest user behaviour models) in a single request to the Akka \cite{akka} cluster---a CQRS/ES \cite{cqrs-es} microservice implementation. The Akka cluster stores its events and snapshots in a journal, implemented by the Apache Cassandra \cite{apache-cassandra} database. Alongside the events and snapshots, which are opaque to non-Akka systems, the \texttt{exercise} microservice saves the sensor data and the matching labels in a properly formed tabular structure. This structure allows the Apache Spark \cite{apache-spark} cluster to be used for typical big data tasks.

The models are implemented in Lorem ipsum dolor sit amet, consectetur adipiscing elit. Donec magna purus, gravida et molestie a, bibendum et libero. Maecenas sed egestas erat. Suspendisse ullamcorper posuere erat, et finibus turpis tempor varius. Aenean tempus tellus sit amet arcu interdum, eu ornare nulla egestas. Nulla facilisi. Sed imperdiet urna et convallis consequat. Nullam nec ex eu leo auctor interdum eu id nunc. Fusce fermentum tempor gravida. Morbi sit amet augue a erat condimentum vulputate. Proin sed mattis lorem, viverra condimentum metus. Suspendisse luctus aliquam placerat. Donec sit amet mollis massa. Aliquam luctus dui in imperdiet accumsan. Nam nisi ligula, dapibus id interdum in, dictum efficitur ligula. Donec bibendum mollis convallis. Fusce maximus non orci quis laoreet.

\subsection{Mobile application}

The sensors send the data in 1s batches; the application on the mobile resamples the sampling rate to 50 Hz. (Accelerometer and gyroscope typically sample at this rate, heart rate and the strain gauges in smart clothes can be up-sampled to 50 Hz easily.) The mobile application ingests the data from the sensors and, together with a statistical model of the user's short-term behaviour, attempts to identify the movement. The models in the mobile application can make successful predictions of sequence of exercises in a session and the properties of each exercise (i.e. weight, number of repetitions, duration, intensity). The model used to predict sequence of exercise sessions and exercises within a session is a Markov chain \cite{markov-chain-exercise}. This approach allows the application to deal with the reality of exercise in a public gym, where the station for the next suggested exercise might not be available. The Markov chain, together with a bio-mechanical model of the main muscle groups, gives the users the flexibility to achieve their workout targets even in crowded gyms. The sequence of exercise predictions for one particular exercise sessions are illustrated on Fig. \ref{model-sequence}.

\begin{figure}[h]
	\begin{center}
		\includegraphics[width=7cm,keepaspectratio]{ri-model-sequence.png}
		\caption{Exercise sequence model}
		\label{model-sequence}
	\end{center}
\end{figure}

The numbers in \ref{model-sequence} represent the count of transitions taken; hence it is possible to calculate the probability of transition from any given state. The state names represent the exercise labels, in real application, they are the real exercise names. The mobile application can either receive the chain when the user selects one of the pre-defined exercise programmes, or it can construct the chain from empty if the user choses to start his or her custom workout. This gives the application an intuitive feel; its suggestions are what the users usually do. Finally, the information in the chain allows the system to identify the most popular sequences of exercises, to identify exercises that the users do not like; more interestingly, the system can use the information in the chain to identify sequence of exercises that leads to the best improvement. (At this point, we do not define what the improvement is: in some applications, it may be weight loss; in other applications, it may be greatest mobility range improvement; and many others.)

To make the next-exercise prediction more accurate, the mobile application uses fined-grained location services. The location services are implemented using bluetooth beacons. The beacons operate in the iBeacon mode \cite{ibeacon}; each beacon in this mode transmits its identifier, a major, and minor values. The mobile application sets up continuous scanning of a major value which identifies exercise equipment, receiving notifications of beacons and their minor values as they come into range. The mobile application then filters the exercise states keeping only those that are associated with a particular area. (Viz Fig. \ref{model-sequence+location}.)

\begin{figure}[h]
	\begin{center}
		\includegraphics[width=7cm,keepaspectratio]{ri-model-sequence+location.png}
		\caption{Exercise sequence model}
		\label{model-sequence+location}
	\end{center}
\end{figure}

With the fine-grained location data available, the application is \emph{expecting} to see a movement that precedes exercises A or C. We call this movement the \emph{setup movement}. The setup movement classifier takes 1s of sensor input and produces probabilities classes that represent groups of exercises; this is particularly important for users that do not have a large number of sensors. If the user only wears an accelerometer on his or her wrist, then the setup movement for barbell bench press is the same as the setup movement for dumbbell bench press. In 94 \% of our test user base of 451, the next exercise prediction refined by the fine-grained location eliminated ambiguity of setup movement detection.

		\includegraphics[width=7cm,keepaspectratio]{ri-model-sequence+setup.png}
		\caption{Exercise sequence model}
		\label{model-sequence+setup}
	\end{center}
\end{figure}

\subsection{Sensor data}

The sensor data in the mobile application is a set of vectors containing 1 second of input data of \texttt{float} values, normalised to a range of $\interval[open]{-1}{1}$ by using a maximum reasonable value for acceleration, rotation, strain and heart rate. (Looking at figure \ref{raw-acceleration}, one might consider $4ms^{-2}$ to be such reasonable acceleration.)

\begin{figure}[hp]

		\includegraphics[width=7cm,keepaspectratio]{ri-raw-acceleration.png}
		\caption{Raw acceleration data}
		\label{raw-acceleration}
	\end{center}
\end{figure}


It is important to realise that a single sensor input alone is not sufficient to accurately distinguish exercise from non-exercise.
